# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/routes/` contains SvelteKit route files like `+page.svelte` and layout modules.
- `src/lib/` holds shared code, including components in `src/lib/components/` and helpers like `src/lib/speech.svelte.ts`.
- `src/app.html` and `src/app.css` define the app shell and global styles.
- `build/` is the static output directory generated by the SvelteKit adapter.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` (or `npm start`): start the Vite dev server on port 4000 for local development.
- `npm run build`: create a production build using the static adapter.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally for a final check.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow existing formatting in Svelte and TypeScript files (tabs are used in current sources).
- Keep Svelte files organized as `<script>` then markup, and co-locate component styles when needed.
- Use PascalCase for components (e.g., `SpeakoutApp.svelte`) and camelCase for functions/variables.
- TypeScript is configured with `strict` and `checkJs` in `tsconfig.json`; keep types sound and avoid implicit `any`.

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no formal test suite in this repo yet.
- Validate changes by running `npm run build` and checking functionality in `npm run preview`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages in history are short, imperative, and sentence‑case (e.g., “add github action to rebuild after any change”).
- PRs should describe the change, include any UI screenshots when visuals change, and note how you validated it (e.g., `npm run dev`).

## Configuration Notes
- The static adapter outputs an SPA with `fallback: 'index.html'` and a production base path of `/speakout` (see `svelte.config.js`).
