# speakout
SpeakOut! a simple speaking toy.

A simple HTML5 speaking app using HTML5 Web Speech API and your browser.

Created over a weekend and tweaked continuously since then. 
It is largely experimental and depends completely on the capabilities of your browser. 

Some voices do not operate as they should. The progress bar may not operate when some voices are playing. 

## Development

Using vanilla JavaScript and the RIOT.js (https://riot.js.org/) library.
